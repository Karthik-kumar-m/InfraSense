# InfraSense – Smart Campus Issue Detection and Reporting Tool

## 🌟 Overview

**InfraSense** is a powerful and intelligent tool designed to revolutionize how campuses detect, report, and resolve infrastructure issues. By combining predictive insights, sentiment-aware categorization, and real-time workload balancing, InfraSense offers a smarter, more efficient way for students and staff to manage campus-related problems. It’s not just a simple issue-reporting tool – it’s a proactive, data-driven solution that anticipates, tracks, and resolves micro-issues before they escalate.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1️⃣ **Predictive Issue Detection**

InfraSense utilizes historical data to **predict potential infrastructure problems** before they arise. By recognizing recurring patterns, such as frequent Wi-Fi disruptions in a specific room or broken projectors on certain days, InfraSense alerts departments ahead of time to take proactive action.

This feature doesn't rely on complex machine learning but uses simple rules-based analysis to deliver early alerts to the right teams, saving time and resources.

### 2️⃣ **Emotion-Aware Issue Categorization**

InfraSense automatically detects the **urgency and tone** of issue reports using sentiment analysis. When students report problems, the system assesses the language used to determine whether an issue is critical or minor.

For example:

* **"The projector is completely dead!!"** – High priority
* **"The fan is a bit noisy sometimes."** – Low priority

This ensures that the most urgent issues are addressed first, streamlining the workflow and helping staff respond effectively.

### 3️⃣ **Gamified Engagement**

To encourage active participation, InfraSense offers a **gamification system** where students earn points for submitting issues and resolving them in a responsible manner. Departments that handle issues quickly and effectively earn **efficiency badges**, fostering a culture of competition and recognition.

### 4️⃣ **Auto-Assignment and Real-Time Workload Balancing**

Instead of manually assigning issues based on keywords, InfraSense intelligently balances the workload across departments and staff members. The system checks the number of pending issues for each department and assigns tasks to the staff members who are currently less overloaded.

This ensures that issues are resolved faster and more efficiently while preventing staff from being overwhelmed.

### 5️⃣ **Real-Time Issue Tracking**

Students can track the status of their reported issues in real-time. InfraSense shows the progress of each issue, including expected resolution times, status updates, and notifications when the issue has been resolved. This transparency builds trust and keeps students informed.

## 💡 How It Works

### Student Portal

* **Submit Issues** – Easily report infrastructure problems with optional image uploads.
* **Live Tracking** – Track the progress of reported issues.
* **Gamified Points** – Earn points for timely and responsible issue reporting.
* **Real-Time Resolution Updates** – Get updates on expected resolution times and status.

### Categorization and Detection Logic

* **Keyword-Based Detection** – Issues are categorized by keywords such as “Wi-Fi,” “projector,” and “air conditioning.”
* **Sentiment Analysis** – The system evaluates urgency based on the tone of the issue report (e.g., angry or frustrated tones are marked as high priority).
* **Predictive Alerts** – InfraSense predicts future issues based on past trends, sending preemptive alerts to departments.

### Staff Dashboard

* **View Issues** – See all current issues reported by students.
* **Filter by Category/Room/Priority** – Sort issues by category, room, or urgency to prioritize.
* **Update Status** – Mark issues as in progress, completed, or pending.
* **Analytics** – Monitor metrics such as response time, issue volume, and department performance.

### Auto-Assignment & Workload Balancing

* **Automatic Department Assignment** – Issues are assigned to the relevant department (e.g., IT for Wi-Fi, Facilities for broken equipment).
* **Workload-Based Staff Assignment** – Issues are automatically assigned to staff members based on their current workload, ensuring fair task distribution.

## 🌈 Additional Features

### Color-Coded Heatmap

InfraSense includes a **heatmap** that visualizes which campus areas are experiencing the most infrastructure issues. This helps departments quickly identify and address trouble zones.

### Voice-Based Reporting

Students can report issues using voice commands for hands-free convenience. InfraSense supports voice input, making it even easier for students to submit complaints on the go.

### QR Code Scanning for Quick Reporting

Each classroom or common area has a **QR code** that students can scan to quickly report issues. The room number is automatically filled in, so students only need to type the problem, making reporting faster and more efficient.

InfraSense stands out for its innovative and practical approach to campus infrastructure management. It offers a **comprehensive solution** with features that not only streamline issue reporting but also predict, categorize, and assign issues intelligently. Here’s why it will impress users and judges alike:

* **Proactive Problem Solving** – Predictive alerts help departments stay ahead of recurring issues.
* **User-Centered Design** – The gamified system and real-time tracking keep students engaged and informed.
* **Efficient Workload Management** – Auto-assignment and workload balancing optimize staff efficiency.
* **Complete Ecosystem** – InfraSense provides a seamless experience for both students and staff, ensuring effective communication and problem resolution.
